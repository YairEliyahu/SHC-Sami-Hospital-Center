       <h5><p>A kidney transplant is a surgery to place a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor into a person</p>
       <p>whose kidneys no longer function properly.</p>
        <p> The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on each side of the spine just below the rib cage. Each is about the size of a fist.</p>
        <p>Their main function is to filter and remove waste, minerals and fluid from the blood by producing urine.</p>
        <p>When kidneys lose this filtering ability, harmful levels of fluid and waste accumulate in the body,</p>
        <p>which can raise blood pressure and result in kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). End-stage renal</p>
        <p> disease occurs when the kidneys have lost about 90% of their ability to function normally.</p>
        <p>  End-stage renal disease occurs when the kidneys have lost about 90% of their</p>
        <p>  ability to function normally.</p>
        <p>  People with end-stage renal disease need to have waste removed from their bloodstream via</p>
        <p>  a machine (dialysis) or a kidney transplant to stay alive.</p>
        <p>  At Mayo Clinic, health care professionals trained in many medical specialties work together as a team </p>
        <p>  to ensure favorable outcomes from your kidney transplant.</p>
        <p>  Having all of this subspecialized expertise in a single place, focused on you,</p>
        <p>  means that you're not just getting one opinion â€” your care is discussed among the team, your test results</p>
        <p>  are available quickly, appointments are scheduled in coordination, and your transplant care team works together to</p>
        <p>  determine what's best for you.</p></h5>
