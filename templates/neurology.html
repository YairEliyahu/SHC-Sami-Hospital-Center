        <p>   Neurology is the branch of medicine dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease</p>
        <p>     involving the brain, the spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.</p>
        <p>     Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience, the scientific study of the nervous system.</p>
        <p>      A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to investigate, </p>
        <p>   diagnose and treat neurological disorders.</p>
        <p>     Neurologists treat a myriad of neurologic conditions, including stroke, seizures, movement disorders such as</p>
        <p>       Parkinson's disease, autoimmune neurologic disorders such as multiple sclerosis, headache disorders like migraine and </p>
        <p>        dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Neurologists may also be involved in clinical research, clinical trials, and basic</p>
        <p>         or translational research. While neurology is a nonsurgical specialty, its corresponding </p>
        <p>          surgical specialty is neurosurgery.</p>
        <p>          Many neurologists also have additional training or interest in one area of neurology, such as stroke, epilepsy, headache, neuromuscular</p>
        <p>           disorders, sleep medicine, pain management, or movement disorders.</p>
        <p>           In the United States and Canada, neurologists are physicians who have completed a postgraduate training</p>
        <p>         period known as residency specializing in neurology after graduation from medical school. This additional training period</p>
        <p>           typically lasts five years, with the first year devoted to training in internal medicine.</p>
