        <p> Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (alternatively spelt orthopaedics), is the branch </p>
        <p>  of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system.</p>
         <p>    Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal</p>
          <p>  trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors,</p>
           <p> and congenital disorders.</p>
            <p>Many developments in orthopedic surgery have resulted from experiences during wartime.</p>
        <p>   On the battlefields of the Middle Ages, the injured were treated with bandages</p>
        <p>   soaked in horses' blood, which dried to form a stiff, if unsanitary, splint.</p>
         <p>    Originally, the term orthopedics meant the correcting of musculoskeletal deformities in children.</p>
         <p>    Nicolas Andry, a professor of medicine at the University of Paris, coined the term in the</p>
         <p>     first textbook written on the subject in 1741. He advocated the use of exercise, manipulation,</p>
          <p>   and splinting to treat deformities in children. His book was directed towards parents, and while </p>
           <p>  some topics would be familiar to orthopedists today, it also included 'excessive sweating of </p>
           <p>   the palms' and freckles.</p>
           <p>  Jean-Andr√© Venel established the first orthopedic institute in 1780, which was the first hospital</p>
           <p>   dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities. He developed the club-foot shoe for</p>
            <p>     children born with foot deformities and various methods to treat curvature of the spine.</p>
             <p>  Advances made in surgical technique during the 18th century, such as John Hunter's research on tendon healing</p>
          <p>     and Percival Pott's work on spinal deformity steadily increased the range of new methods available for effective </p>
           <p>     treatment. Robert Chessher, a pioneering British orthopedist, invented the double-inclined plane, used to treat</p>
         <p>lower-body bone fractures, in 1790.</p>
