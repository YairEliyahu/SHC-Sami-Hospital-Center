        <h5><p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and </p>
        <p>  spread to other parts of the body. 
        <p>   Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of </p>
        <p>   trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division)</p>
        <p>   to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die,</p>
        <p>   and new cells take their place.</p>
        <p>     Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply</p>
        <p>   when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be </p>
        <p>    cancerous or not cancerous (benign). </p>
        <p>  Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in </p>
        <p>  the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). </p>
        <p>  Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers</p>
        <p>  of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.</p>
        <p>   Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors </p>
        <p>   usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large,</p>
        <p>    however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.</p>
        <p>  Many times, cancer cells rely so heavily on these abnormal behaviors that they can’t survive without them.</p>
        <p>    Researchers have taken advantage of this fact, developing therapies that target the abnormal features of </p>
        <p>    cancer cells. For example, some cancer therapies prevent blood vessels from growing toward tumors, essentially</p>
        <p>     starving the tumor of needed nutrients.  </p>
        <p>  Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function,</p>
        <p>   especially how they grow and divide.</p>
        <p>   The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body’s ability to do<p> 
        <p>     so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life. </p>                                                                                                   <p>    Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur.
        <p>     Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.</p>
