            <p> As part of the Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery Service, the Clinic treats </p>
            <p>   kidney stones. The Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery Service specializes in </p>
            <p>    innovative surgery to treat stones in the urinary tract, tumors, stenosis, etc.</p>
            <p>          The Kidney Stone Clinic offers patients an integrative, </p>
            <p>          comprehensive and unique treatment provided by urologists, nephrologists and </p>
            <p>     endocrinologists to treat the existing stone as well as to prevent the formation of kidney</p>
            <p>       stones in the future.</p>
            <p>      Most kidney stones are currently treated with minimally invasive procedures,</p>
            <p>        which are replacing open surgery, which until recently had been the norm. State-of-the-art</p>
            <p>         instruments and laser technology facilitate the treatment of urinary tract</p>
            <p>     stones through a tiny opening, eliminating the need for incisions. Kidney and ureter</p>
            <p>      stones are crushed using extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and an endoscope.</p>
            <p>    This technique is also used to treat other problem such as stenosis, to</p>  
            <p>    remove tumors and to correct urinary tract defects. Large kidney stones are treated </p>
            <p>    with the minimally invasive Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and nephrolithotripsy</p>
            <p>    (PCNL) procedure.</p>
            <p>    A complementary treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which combines</p>
            <p>    mitomycin C chemotherapy together with heating the bladder with radio waves. </p>
            <p>    Heating the bladder wall together with flushing with chemotherapy enables better </p>
            <p>    infiltration of the substance into the tissue, and has been proven to prevent the</p>
            <p>   illnessâ€™s recurrence or progression.</p>
