        <h5><p>
            <p>    An ophthalmologist is a physician who undergoes subspecialty training in </p>
            <p>     medical and surgical eye care.Following a medical degree, a doctor specialising</p>
             <p>      in ophthalmology must pursue additional postgraduate residency training</p>
              <p>       specific to that field. This may include a one-year integrated internship that involves</p>
               <p>        more general medical training in other fields such as internal medicine or </p>
                <p>        general surgery. Following residency, additional specialty training (or fellowship)</p>
                <p>         may be sought in a particular aspect of eye pathology.</p>
                 <p>         Ophthalmologists prescribe medications to treat eye diseases,</p>
                 <p>          implement laser therapy, and perform surgery when needed</p>
                  <p>          . Ophthalmologists provide both primary and specialty eye care - medical and surgical.</p>
                  <p>       Most ophthalmologists participate in academic research on eye diseases at some point</p>
                <p>       in their training and many include research as part of their career.</p>
                 <p>       Ophthalmology has always been at the forefront of medical research with a long</p>
                 <p>        history of advancement and innovation in eye care.</p>
                  <p>         also known as ocular surgery, is surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa by an ophthalmologist.</p>
                  <p>       The eye is a fragile organ, and requires extreme care before, during, </p>
                   and after a surgical procedure. An eye surgeon is responsible for selecting </p>
                   <p>    the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient and for taking the necessary</p>
                   <p> safety precautions.</p>
